978gridder
==========

Based on the excellent 960gridder at https://github.com/peol/960gridder, with customisations for my own use

The original was changed this way:
- converted to 978 grid
- no margin on first and last column
- streamlined the column overlay, so that the overlay represents content areas only or margins/non content areas only
- defaulted the horizontal lines to off 


How to use
----------

Add this code to a bookmarklet in your browser:

javascript:(function()%7Bdocument.body.appendChild(document.createElement(%27script%27)).src%3D%27//www.deakin.edu.au/__data/assets/js_file/0014/50270/978.gridder.js%27%3B%7D)()%3B

Click the bookmark to overlay the 978 grid on the current page. Thats it.
