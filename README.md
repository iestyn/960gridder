978gridder
==========

Based on the excellent 960gridder at https://github.com/peol/960gridder, with customisations for my own use

The original was changed this way:
- converted to 978 grid
- no margin on first and last column
- streamlined the column overlay, so that the overlay represents content areas only or margins/non content areas only
- defaulted the horizontal lines to off 

How to use
==========

Add this code to a bookmarklet in your browser.

Click the bookmark to overlay the 978 grid on the current page. Thats it.
